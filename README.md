## answers to questions

- 01: text can be seen in the middle of the page
- 02: 10 is changed to 20 and red text was added underneath 
- 03: the code is going to loop up until the number 10 and add 1 to i: so that at a certain point it is going to exceed the 10 limit speciefied by the 'counter' variable. it is then going to log and display i.
- 04: an constant array is created with all the movies specified inside, then an ordered list is created, loop created to list every movie inside the array done with .length.
- 05: 1/ callback function, it calles for a function inside a function. 2/ parseTitle is going to make the movie title lowercase and call the wrapWithTag function. write wrapped. 3/ the wrapWithTag function is essentially going to write html so that the various movie titles are automatically placed within tags. wrap around the data, u can specify multiple parameters thats why the brackets are there.
- 06: for each was used instead of parsTitle
- 07: the map function creates a new array from calling a function, so instead of toLowerCase inside forEach, now it does the lowercasing on its own
- 08: first the movies get wrapped in 'li' with the wrapwithtag function and afterwards that new array is then warpped itself in 'ol' with the same function again only the content has changed to wrappedMOvies.join(). this adds everything at ones.
- 09: 1/ the parsetitle is going to transfrom every title to lower case and if a     title start with 'THE' it is going to log that title with text in front and change it back to uppercase. then return the title.
 2/ arrow functions right?
- 10: the filter is used to create a new array of all the titles in the movie array starting with 'the'. that new list is going to be displayed
- 11: 1/ object. the titles before were only title, now it is a movie object with multiple parameters and values. it has a year, title,... 2/ ln 51
- 12: its is going to display all the values from the objects. warpped in 'p' tags and then in 'li' and 'ul'.
- 13: 1/ because multiple properties 2/sort uses a-b for numbers because a lot of errors can happen
- 14:
